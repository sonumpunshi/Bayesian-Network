# Bayesian-Network

This project involved creating a program to work with a Bayesian Network, a graphical model representing the probabilistic relationships among a set of variables. The project involves three tasks: learning conditional probability tables (CPTs) from training data, calculating joint probability distributions (JPDs) using the learned CPTs, and performing inference by enumeration. 

The Bayesian Network comprises four binary variables (B, G, C, F) representing the states of a simple domain involving a person, George, who may or may not watch TV, feed his cat, etc., based on whether there is a baseball game on TV and if he has cat food.
